I've been voting since 1984, when I proudly cast my first ballot for Ronald Reagan. I've been a conservative Republican my entire life, I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, priciple and conscience require me to do just that. I'm voting for Joe Biden. When you fill out your own ballot, ask yourself. Who will best restore decency and civility to the White House? Who can I be proud to tell my children and grandchildren I voted for. My fellow Republicans, it's not easy going against the head of our party. Believe me, I know. But I also know that character, moral leadership, integrity are values that we cannot put aside when we cast our vote for president. If we hold onto these values, our country will be better for it and so will our party. And please, don’t let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you’re somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put the country over party. That’s what I’m doing. I hope you’ll join me.
