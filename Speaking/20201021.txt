So I started my Youtube channel about a year ago and it was awkward to say the least it's true what they say.

When you first start a Youtube channel it's strange to do it. You're putting yourself out there and you don't know who's gonna watch. You don't even know if this is gonna lead to something better. In fact it's pretty scary, even people close to you will say that wasn't so good, maybe you shouldn't try.

But at this point, in my career, I realized that if I spend enough time on virtually anything and I really pay attention and I really work on it. I can figure it out, and I think that's true for a lot of people, with enough time and attention you can figure out anything.
