Hi, I just wanted to pop in here real quick and wish everybody a Happy Thanksgiving or Happy Thursday if you don't celebreate and I know this is a tough year for a lot of us. Myself included. I am not home with my family. I'm by myself today but to make the most of it. I was like you know I am not the biggest fan of turkey for Thanksgiving. I know that's you know an unpopular opinion but I decided. I'm gonna theat myself to some sushi so I just picked this up at the grocery store and I'm going to be enjoying that tonight and I'm also Facetiming with my family so in past years I would be with my grandparents right now but of course they're in a high-risk group so not with them but Facetime will make up for it. So I wish you all the best and stay safe.
