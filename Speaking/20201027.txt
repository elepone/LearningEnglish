What are the different uses between 'will' and 'be going to'? We use 'will' when we make a decision about the future at the moment of speaking. "What do I want to drink? I think I will have a coffee." We use 'be going to' when the decision is made before speaking. "I know what I want. I am going to have a tea." We can also use 'will' to talk about predictions based on something we expect to happen. "I will probably be late because the buses are often delayed." We use 'be going to' to talk about a predictions based on evidence. "Look at those black clouds! It is going to rain soon."
Right, I'm off now. I'm going to buy a coffee.
