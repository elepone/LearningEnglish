Hey so I want to talk Fleets for a second but ironically not on Fleets and the reason for that is that I prefer sort of a more natural vlog format where I'm not exactly scripting. What I'm gonna say I do spend a little bit of time thinking about what I want to talk about but to me this feels a lot more authentic when I can kind of just talk with you as if we're at a coffee shop together. So I feel like the 30 second limit that I have to make a Fleet realy isn't my style but it was fun making that video yesterday so you know maybe I'll use it once in a while and see kind of what works for me but I do wanna say a big congrats to everybody at Twitter.

I do think it's pretty awesome that you pushed out such a huge feature and did a good job at it. I think this is so funny I was looking at a Tweet. the Twitter account had posted and they said some of you hating but we see you fleeting and I love that I think that is feature will take off and will kind of do its own thing I hope that it has its own personality and isn't a copycat of Instagram so we'll deinitely see how that rolls out.
